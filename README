This project contains a Pixel class, and Image class, and ImageCommand interface, two classes
Filter and ColorTransformation that implement ImageCommand, and an ImageCreator class all in the
model package. There is also a utils package containing the ImageUtil class.

Pixel is a single pixel in an image, having three channels that represent its color. It also
contains an enum, PixelChannel, that allows the user to easily distinguish between channels.

Image is a rectangle of pixels. An image stores a 2d array of pixels, whose dimensions are
determined in the constructor.

ImageCommand is a command that can be executed upon an image. ImageCommand objects all have a "go"
method, which takes an Image upon which the command is executed.

Filter is an ImageCommand that alters the channels of the pixels in a given image based on the
channels of their neighbors. It contains an enum, FilterMatrix, which contains pre-made filters for
the user to select from.

ColorTransformation is an ImageCommand that alters the channels of the pixels in a given image based
the other channels of those individual pixels. It contains an enum, ColorTransformationMatrix, which
contains pre-made color transformations for the user to select from.

ImageCreator is a class containing two static methods, allowing the user to either create a
checkerboard image or a solid square of given color based on certain parameters.

ImageUtil is a tool used to read PPM images from the computer's files, and to write a given Image
into a PPM file.
