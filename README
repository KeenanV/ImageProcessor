This project contains a Pixel interface and its implementation SimplePixel, a Layer class and its
implementation SimpleLayer, an Image class and its implementation SimpleImage, an LayerCommand
interface and its two implementations Filter and ColorTransformation, and a LayerCreator class all
in the model package. There is also a utils package containing the ImageUtil class.

Pixel is a single pixel in an image, having three channels that represent its color. It also
contains an enum, PixelChannel, that allows the user to easily distinguish between channels.
SimplePixel is a pixel with just the functionality outlined in the Pixel interface.

Layer is a rectangle of pixels which can be transparent or opaque. It can produce information about
those pixels, and replace pixels with new ones. SimpleLayer is a layer with just the functionality
outlined in the Layer interface, storing its pixels in a 2D array.

Image is a collection of layers. It can produce information about those layers, and can add or
remove layers. SimpleImage is an image that with just the functionality outlined in the Image
interface, storing its layers in a List<Array>.

LayerCommand is a command that can be executed upon an layer. LayerCommand objects all have a "go"
method, which takes an Layer upon which the command is executed.

Filter is a LayerCommand that alters the channels of the pixels in a given image based on the
channels of their neighbors. It contains an enum, FilterMatrix, which contains pre-made filters for
the user to select from.

ColorTransformation is a LayerCommand that alters the channels of the pixels in a given image based
the other channels of those individual pixels. It contains an enum, ColorTransformationMatrix, which
contains pre-made color transformations for the user to select from.

LayerCreator is a class containing static methods, allowing the user to create a checkerboard
image, a solid square of given color, or other simple images based on certain parameters.

ImageUtil is a tool used to read image files from the computer's files, and to write a given Image
into a file.
