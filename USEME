GUI:
The buttons on the top can be used to load/save the project as a multi-layer project or as a single image representing the top-most visible layer. It can also load an execute a script and create a new image with specified dimensions.

The buttons on the left side are used to alter the top layer. The current color selected by the color chooser is what will be used to create a solid rectangle.

The buttons on the right side modify the image by hiding/showing layers, adding/deleting layers.

The image itself is a visual representation of the topmost visible layer and is scrollable.
